They are one of the most marginalised communities as they have no access to dry rations to sustain themselves. To save them from dying of hunger in these uncertain times, Badlav Seva Samiti organised donation drives in the nearby regions during the lockdown. We provided dry ration to families facing lockdown hunger. All these efforts were made by taking utmost care about the hygiene and safety and keeping in mind the precautions to be taken during the pandemic.  "

            android:text="        Gender discrimination and violence against women are common in India. According to a report by the National Health and Family Survey, one in every three women in India, starting from the age of 15, has faced some form of domestic or sexual violence. This same survey also reported that 54.4% of rural women and 46.8% of urban women believe that domestic abuse is normal. Right from a young age, women are made to believe that they’re inferior. They are taught to be dependent on the male figures in their lives. These ideas of misogyny and patriarchy are so deep-rooted that the women become indifferent to the abuse. Lack of education, awareness, and fear of social stigma has made thousands of women suffer in silence. According to NHFS-4, only 14% of women who reported being abused actively ask for help.  "

We received several applications from women asking for help and we did whatever we could with our resources to help them out of their situations. We’ve successfully helped many women in ending their sufferings at the hands of their partners or other family members. We’re also continuously spreading awareness about domestic violence as an attempt to reach out to people who might need our help.  "

Our country is known for its regal heritage and the various cultures and art forms that are a part of this, we as an organisation work for preserving and promoting the glorious fields of art and culture. Furthermore, the organization assists in the uplifting of SC/ST communities and other minority issues. Since these domains cover a wide range of social evils and to eradicate all of those we’re working one step at a time. We’re extremely grateful to all the prominent social figures for their association with our NGO at several social events, their presence with our organisation has helped us remarkably in gaining more recognition in the society which helps us to expand our range.
